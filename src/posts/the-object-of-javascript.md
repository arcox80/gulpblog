While looking for some more information, I stumbled across a nice quote from [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com). They said, "In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript." While many people who see that simply nod their heads in agreement, I had a stronger reaction. A little light bulb came on, and I felt like I had taken a big step forward in my understanding. And here's the kicker, I've probably heard something similar to that numerous times already.

The difference this time is that I now have a stronger foundation in my knowledge of the language, so statements like these finally have an impact on me. The first couple of times you hear it, your head is still swimming trying to absorb all the knowledge that is being dumped on you. Then once you start getting some of the concepts, you once again hear it, and you're like okay, but it doesn't really sink in. It wasn't until I finished a fresh round of lessons on arrays, objects, and functions that it hit home. Maybe I'm just slow, and people reading this are thinking, "Yeah, we got it the first time." For me it wasn't until I have worked with all these different types of objects that it truly made sense to me.

When it comes to JavaScript, almost everything is a type of object. Arrays, functions, maths, dates, regular expressions, and yes, even objects, are objects. Imagine that. Basically, all values except primitive values are objects. Primitive values are strings, numbers, true, false, null, and (our very favorite) undefined. Objects are variables containing variables. While variables contain a single value, objects can contain many values. Objects can hold functions (called methods) and arrays inside its properties. Arrays can contain objects in its indices. It's all just one big incestuous family.

You may be reading this and thinking that this guy has a lot to learn still, and I wouldn't argue with that. But as I mentioned in my previous post, I'm making progress. I can handle the insults, so feel free to unleash them. I'm going to go back to watching more videos.
