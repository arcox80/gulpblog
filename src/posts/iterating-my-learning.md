My first experience with JavaScript was taking the first couple of lessons found on Codecademy. I got through Unit 1 with not too much trouble. However, I ran into trouble almost immediately in Unit 2. There was a pretty big gap between the two units, and they were talking about things in Unit 2 that were not mentioned in Unit 1. Frustrated I switched to Code School, and I found them to be a little more comprehensive and polished in their teaching.

Of course after the first couple of free lessons, they hit you up for some money. I felt good about them, so I paid for a month as an evaluation period. Well, it wasn’t much later when I started with [Devschool](https://devschool.rocks). Jim’s full immersion style left me floundering and made me realize how little I actually knew. It really helped me steup up my game. I came to the conclusion that Code School is nice, but it doesn’t go into enough depth on a lot of things. So I then purchased a book, "Head First JavaScript Programming." They had a nice style that really tried to make it simple for you, but they also repeated themselves constantly throughout the book. It was by design. They keep repeating the information in different ways figuring that one of these ways will work with you. It’s a nice idea, but it does get a little frustrating.

Well, I got through all the major headings of the language, and then they have you start building a Battleship game. I thought that was pretty cool at first, but then I realized that they were just telling you everything to do. There was no real figuring it out for yourself and then checking. Once again frustrated, I went back to Code School thinking I would be better off working on their challenges. Now, I was repeating what I had learned on purpose, but I was also attempting challenges which made it feel worthwhile. 

After catching up in Code School with what I had already learned, I then turned to [Front End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com). A subscription with them is included with Devschool, so I decided to finally take advantage of it. I decided to once again go through the JavaScript videos (except the very first one). After I learned some new stuff, I would then switch back over to Code School and work on their units until I was caught up with the videos. I think I finally got a system down that will help me master the language. 

The best part is that I then get to watch the Devschool lessons, and I can notice a huge difference in my comprehension level. I’m working on projects that put what I have learned into practical use. That is where the true understanding comes in. I also know where I will go from here. Once I finish the Front End Masters beginner developer courses, I will read Crockford’s "JavaScript: The Good Parts." Then after that I plan to tackle Kyle Simpson’s "You Don’t Know JS" series. All the while I’ll be coding and learning with Devschool and putting everything I’m picking up to use. So, it took me repeating the basics numerous times before concepts finally started to take hold. And as you can see my plan moving forward has me often circling back. I have to give the Head First people more credit for purposefully doing it in their book. Now, I finally feel good about the direction my learning is going, even if it is filled with loops. Of course I still have to find time to master CSS, and I want to get proficient in Ruby, and...the list goes on....
