After researching coding bootcamps for quite some time, I knew that I could not afford nor lived close enough to the top tier ones, and I knew that I would not get a quality education from the bottom dollar ones either. When I finally came across Devschool, I felt like I found something that was the best of both worlds. It had great reviews on the school ratings sites, and I definitely connected with its philosophy.

I really liked that the bulk of your education would be comprised of 1-on-1 sessions with someone who was a coding expert (not a recent graduate of the school). I was pleased to see that group sessions would also be mixed into the curriculum mimicking a classroom environment. Finally, I was pleased to see that you could learn at your own pace and that it was tailored to your own needs and goals. 

What really set Devschool apart for me was the idea that you do not graduate until you get a job. All the other schools say they will help you get employed, but based on their reviews; it seems to largely be a broken promise. However, here at Devschool they are committed to turning each individual student into a great programmer and a gainfully employed one as well. Bootcamp graduates still face an uphill battle in getting employed, and itâ€™s nice to know that when the time comes for me, I will have Devschool working with me and making me a better programmer and job candidate until I do get employed.

But don't take my word for it, check out Devschool for yourself! [Click here.](https://devschool.rocks "Devschool Homepage")
